RoundedImageView
================

A fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners based on the original [example from Romain Guy](http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/11/android-recipe-1-image-with-rounded-corners/)

There are many ways to create rounded corners in android, but this is the fastest and best one that I know of because it:
* does **not** create a copy of the original bitmap
* does **not** use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased.
* does **not** use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas.

If you know of a better method, let me know and I'll implement it!

Also has proper support for:
* Borders
* All `ScaleType`s
  * Borders are drawn at view edge, not bitmap edge.
  * Except on edges where the bitmap is smaller than the view
  * Borders are **not** scaled up/down with the image (correct width and radius are maintained)
* Anti-aliasing
* Transparent backgrounds
* Hardware acceleration
* Support for TransitionDrawables (XML attrs only)


Import Library
----

Import Library: `RoundedImageView/library/`

Maven
----
Execute this in your workspace:
```
  git clone https://github.com/kolipass/RoundedImageView.git
  cd ./RoundedImageView/
  mvn clean install
```
To run example:
````
cd ./example
mvn android:deploy android:run
````
Add this dependency:
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.makeramen.rounded</groupId>
            <artifactId>library</artifactId>
            <version>0.1</version>
            <type>apklib</type>
        </dependency>
```

Use Library
----
Define in xml:

```xml
<com.makeramen.rounded.RoundedImageView
        xmlns:makeramen="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.makeramen.rounded.RoundedImageView"
        android:id="@+id/imageView1"
        android:src="@drawable/photo1"
        android:scaleType="centerCrop"
        makeramen:corner_radius="30dip"
        makeramen:border="2dip"
        makeramen:border_color="#333333"
        makeramen:round_background="true" />
```

Or in code:

```java
RoundedImageView iv = new RoundedImageView(context);
iv.setScaleType(ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
iv.setCornerRadius(10);
iv.setBorderWidth(2);
iv.setBorderColor(Color.DKGRAY);
iv.setRoundedBackground(true);
iv.setImageDrawable(drawable);
iv.setBackground(backgroundDrawable);
```

Known Issues
--------------------------------------
* Does not round images set by `setImageResource(int resId)`. This causes bitmaps to be inflated on the UI thread anyway, so you should use `setImageDrawable` or `BitmapFactory` and `setImageBitmap()` instead.
* Programmatically setting attributes with TransitionDrawables not yet supported.
* Only tested support for BitmapDrawables and TransitionDrawables (with BitmapDrawables in them). Other types might work but may have unexpected behavior.
